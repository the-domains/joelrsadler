### You Don't Know My Life

_"Personalization" in Digital Advertising_

Way up on my list of "things I'm over" is Dynamic Creative Optimization --- especially when used as an assumed synonym for "personalized advertising." I feel stronger about this than is commensurate with the significance of the problem but, nevertheless, I have to take a stand.

With the advent of programmatic media buying in display advertising, specifically RTB, the prospect of being able to deliver the perfect creative for each and every individual to whom you serve an impression became an imaginable possibility. Merle described this possibility as "addressability at scale" in the very useful but blandly-titled book, "[Rise of the Platform Marketer][0]." You have probably come to use the term "personalization" to refer to this possibility.

This is where I start to get hot under the collar.

The word "personalization" has been diluted (don't get me started on the word "algorithm") to the point that it basically encompasses any advertising that attempts to take information about the user into account when deciding whether or not to show them an ad and then which ad to show them. This dilution was spurred on by reports that "personalized" advertising performs better than "unpersonalized" advertising.

**Why am I upset?**

Because the banner of "personalization" has been used to justify expensive, gimmicky solutions that by definition do not deliver personalization and benefit neither the people to whom the ads are served nor the advertisers serving them.

Personalization means to tailor an experience/good/service to the unique preferences of an individual person. Unfortunately, the following words have been assumed to be synonyms of personalization but absolutely are not: contextualization, localization, and categorization.

Take this quick, 1-question quiz:

> True or False: modifying a creative at runtime based on the weather report for the location where your IP geolocation service says the user is at that moment is an example of personalization.

From what I can tell, the majority of people in digital advertising fail this quiz. Therein lies the problem.

The quiz question is, at best, an example of localization.

Personalization, on the other hand, is having the ability to show an ad that takes into account weather conditions and only doing it if the person to whom the ad will be served prefers to see the weather report reflected in ads featuring your brand.

Personalization requires that the needs and desires of each unique individual be made your highest priority.

**Why does this distinction matter?**

It matters because true personalization is a win for both consumers and brands regardless of the channel or context. Examples:

* Your daily coffee shop has your extra-shot, coconut milk latte queued up at just the right temperature before you utter your order.
* Your hotel has replaced the pillows on your bed with firmer ones you prefer before you even make the request.
* You see ads that feature images of happy families at the beach because it makes you think of home and a hoped for future even though you are a single college student in Michigan.

By contrast, false personalization leads brands to spend money on technology they don't need in order to deliver customers an experience they don't want.

As an advertiser you need to ask yourself, "Am I investing in technology that is capable of truly delivering a personalized experience for individual people at scale, or am I lazily assuming that tailoring creative based on impersonal facts constitutes personalization?"

There are only two ways to deliver true personalization:

* Get to know an individual person well enough over time to learn the nuances of their unique preferences. This is clearly not feasible at the scale of digital advertising.
* Invest heavily in data science to build predictive models that..., well, this really deserves a dedicated article of it's own because it opens up a whole other can of worms. I'll tackle that separately.
